# Incomplete
* The number of hash function and the filter size need to be calculated independently.
* Hashing should take place in a separate class (in order to test it properly).
* testOfFalsePositives needs to revisited in a more rigorous manner.

#### Purpose
To provide a Bloom Filter data structure where some false positives are tolerable

#### Example
    

#### Installation
